# MedicAssist
This project aims to create a useful interface between patients and doctors, where the patients can store all their medical records and reports, and the doctors can easily access their patients’ history for a better understanding and treatment. This is very much required in the modern day, as patients don’t maintain their medical records properly and often misplace them. This is of great hinderance to the doctors as they don’t have the required evidence to take decisions. Hence more often than not, patients have to take the same tests again and this also increases the cost of healthcare for the patients.

Another important feature is to prevent the purchase of prescription-less drugs from a pharmacy, which is increasingly becoming a menace in our country. This is done by ensuring that only the doctor can modify the drugs prescribed to a patient. When the pharmacies use our website, they will be able to see the drugs prescribed by the doctor to that particular patient. Using this list, the pharmacy can provide only the drugs which are doctor-prescribed.

The above two features make our website unique and one-of-a-kind. Most of the existing websites, only serve the purpose of finding the doctors and booking appointments.

Our system users must register as members of this system and keep updating their medical history. The doctors should also register, to keep track of their patients and view their medical history. Patients can also book appointments from a list specialised doctors at particular locations. The following are the sections that our website comprises of –

-	**Main/Front page and the Login/Signup areas** – The main page consists of the login and signup options for the patients and doctors. It also consists of the link to the pharmacy area. The main page also comprises of a brief introduction as to what our website offers. The login options result in a popup where the users can enter their details. The signup options take the users to a form, where the users can register.

-	**Pharmacy area** – This section initially consists of a login for the patients. Upon validation, it brings up the list of medicines prescribed by the various doctors, sorted according to the date of appointment.

- **Patient area** – This area consists of 3 webpages. The first part is where the patients can upload their medical documents and records. The second page is for booking appointments with various doctors. The final page is where the patients can view the doctor’s prescriptions.

-	**Doctor’s area** – This section consists of 4 webpages. The first page consists of the list of patients that the doctor attends to. The second part is where the doctors can view the patient’s medical documents and records. The third page is for uploading the prescriptions of the patient. The final page is where the doctor can upload the list of medicines that are required by the pharmacy.
